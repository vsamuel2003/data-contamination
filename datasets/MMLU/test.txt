Adjoining the farmland was a 50-acre ranch, which was owned by a rancher. In 2004, the rancher forged the farmer's signature on a deed and purported to convey the farmland to a grocer. The grocer paid the rancher $100,000 as the purchase price for the farmland. The following year, the grocer sold the property to a buyer for $125,000. The deed from the grocer to the buyer was properly executed and recorded by the buyer. This jurisdiction has the following \"pure race\" recording statute in effect:\"No conveyance or other instrument is valid as against purchasers for a valuable consideration who record first. \"After the buyer took possession of the farmland, he renovated the farmhouse that was located on the property and made improvements valued at $50,000. In 2006, the farmer returned to visit his sister. During his visit, the farmer went to the farmland to inspect his farmland. While doing so, he encountered the buyer, who informed the farmer that he was the new owner of the property. The farmer thereupon instituted suit to quiet title to the farmland.

        "question": "A company contracted with a builder to construct a new corporate headquarters for a fixed price of $100 million. At the time of the contract, structural steel was widely available and was included in the contract as a $6 million item. Before work began on the project, tornado damage shut down the production facility of the biggest structural steel supplier in the country, and the price of structural steel increased by 20% as a result. The builder informed the company of the steel price increase, and the parties then orally agreed to increase the project price to $101 million. The builder proceeded with construction and delivered the project on time. The company paid the builder $100 million but refused to pay the additional $1 million. If the builder sues the company for $1 million, is the builder likely to prevail?\n(A) No, because the modification was never reduced to a writing signed by the party to be charged.\n(B) No, because there was no consideration for the modification of the contract.\n(C) Yes, because the company\u00d5s promise was supported by consideration.\n(D) Yes, because the modification was fair and equitable in view of the unanticipated increase in the price of structural steel.",

Although the law allows a specified number of reporters to observe an execution, only the prison warden's official statement that the prisoner was \"executed as provided by law\" at a certain time and date may be published. The purpose of the law is to protect the public, particularly children, from the details of executions. After a particular execution was mishandled, causing the prisoner to suffer, a newspaper in the state published a story describing the event in detail. The story was written by the newspaper's reporter, who was permitted to observe the execution but did not promise prison officials that he would report only the warden's official statement. A prosecutor subsequently filed charges against the newspaper for publishing the details of the execution in violation of the state law. Is this prosecution constitutional?\n(A) No, because the prosecution seeks to punish the publication of lawfully obtained, truthful information about a matter of public significance, without adequate justification.\n(B) No, because the reporter did not promise prison officials that he would report only the warden's official statement about the execution.\n(C) Yes, because publication of the details of such events might cause psychological damage to some children.\n(D) Yes, because the newspaper should have brought an action to test the validity of the law before publishing the reporter's story.",
